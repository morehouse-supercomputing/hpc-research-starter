# HPC Research Starter

A starter scaffold for running your research on HPC with AI-assisted workflows. Clone it, drop your own research into the structure, and use AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor) plus Tapis/Slurm on Vista to accelerate work you already know how to do.

## How to use this during the workshop

1. **Make it yours.** On GitHub, click **Use this template** (or fork) to create a copy under your own account. Your work lives in your repo.
2. **Want help?** Add `ashleyscruse` as a collaborator on your copy (Settings → Collaborators). That lets me look at your code and help when you're stuck. Your work stays yours.
3. **Pull workshop additions.** If shared materials get added to the starter during the week, add it as a remote and pull from `main`:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream <starter-repo-url>
   git pull upstream main
   ```

## Structure

| Path | What goes here |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project context the AI reads. Keep it current so Claude Code knows your project. |
| `templates/` | Blank workshop templates: research brief, methodology, analysis, metrics reference, peer review, submission plan, compute log. Fill these in as you go; your AI prompts read them. `templates/methodology.md` is the one the pipeline scripts read. |
| `data/raw/` | Original downloaded data. Not tracked in Git (lives on Vista `$SCRATCH`). |
| `data/processed/` | Cleaned, joined, analysis-ready data. Not tracked in Git. |
| `scripts/` | Your pipeline: download, build dataset, train, evaluate. |
| `notebooks/` | Interactive exploration. |
| `results/` | Metrics, predictions, trained models. Not tracked in Git. |
| `figures/` | Publication-quality figures (tracked; they go in the paper). |
| `literature/` | Your papers and PDFs. Kept local, **not** in Git (copyrighted work shouldn't go to GitHub, and PDFs eat storage). Your library of record is Zotero; on a new machine just recreate an empty `literature/` folder. |
| `jobs/` | Slurm/Tapis job submission scripts for Vista. |

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## The workflow

The framework has five stages. The pattern is the same at every stage: **you make the decision in a template, point the AI at it, and review what it produces.** You bring the research; the scaffold, the AI tools, and HPC make it faster.

**Start here:** open this repo in your editor (VS Code, Cursor, or Claude Code) and say hi — you'll meet **Sage**, your guide, who introduces the process and walks you through filling in your first templates.

| Stage | You fill in | The AI helps | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 · Ideation | `templates/research-brief.md` | survey and verify the literature | question, gap, data, venue |
| 2 · Design | `templates/methodology.md` | — (you answer the five questions) | the plan every script reads |
| 3 · Compute | — | write the pipeline scripts, then run them on Vista | data on Vista, raw results |
| 4 · Analysis | `templates/analysis.md` | read metrics + SHAP, make figures | interpretation + figures |
| 5 · Publication | `templates/submission-plan.md` | assemble the paper | venue-formatted draft |

A typical loop:

1. Fill in the stage's template (start with `templates/methodology.md`).
2. Point the AI at it, e.g. *"Read templates/methodology.md and write scripts/build_dataset.py to produce the analysis table described there."*
3. Review what it produced. You decide; the AI accelerates.
4. Stage data on Vista and submit `jobs/train.slurm` to the `gh` queue, then interpret, visualize, and write.

## Skills

`skills/` is where reusable `SKILL.md` instructions live, so you can package a repeatable task once and use it in any tool (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, or Claude on the web). It's empty for now; see [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for how to add and use them.
